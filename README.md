# RanDish
RanDish is an app that I've created in Pyton using PyQt,SQLite and Designer. 
RanDish is a portmateau(combination of atleast two words.) of word 'Random' and 'Dish'. This app will give you a random dish with ingredients and instruction on how to prepare the dish and an additional to 5-7 minute video from Youtube.com.

But, In this project I will now be using HTML,CSS and JavaScript(might also use a SQL). I will try to recreate the app and turn it into a website.
